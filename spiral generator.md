## Overview
An interactive Scratch game focused on timing, movement, and score tracking. The project emphasizes logical thinking, event-driven programming, and user interaction.

## Gameplay
- Objective: Avoid obstacles and score as many points as possible
- Controls: Keyboard-based movement
- Game Over: Collision with obstacles

## Features Implemented
- Event-driven logic using Scratch blocks
- Variables for score and game state
- Conditional logic for collisions
- Animations and sprite interactions
- Sound effects and visual feedback

## What I Learned
- Designing interactive game logic
- Debugging collisions and timing issues
- Improving gameplay through iteration
- Organizing Scratch scripts across sprites
